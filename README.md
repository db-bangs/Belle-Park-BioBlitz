# Belle Park BioBlitz R Shiny
R Shiny application mapping iNaturalist observations of the Belle Park BioBlitz.

Over the week May 23-29, 2022, The [Belle Park Project](https://belleparkproject.com/events/bioblitz) conducted an iNaturalist BioBlitz to record species in Belle Park. The week saw 32 participants record 325 unique species over 560 observations.

This R Shiny dashboard displays a map of all observations filter-able by taxon and date, and a table of all observations in a separate tab.

iNaturalist user-indicated licensing, typically CC-BY-NC, is attached to observations where applicable.
